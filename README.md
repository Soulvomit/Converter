2. ALIEN

List the steps. Be as detailed as you can? (Example: Hold the toothpaste with your left hand; turn the cap anti-clockwise).

-Lay toothbrush on counter or sink with the brush facing up.

-Hold toothpaste in right hand (or left if you prefer).

-Turn the cap anti-clockwise.

-Apply toothpaste to the brush, by squeezing the paste holder.

-Turn the cap on clockwise.

-Put the toothpaste on counter or sink.

-Put toothbrush in mouth.

-With the brush side of the toothbrush facing towards your teeth, start scrubbing.

-Make sure to cover all your teeth.

-Make sure to do all side of your teeth.

-After 3 min. of scrubbing you are done.

-Congratulations.

3. GIVE YOUR THOUGHTS ON BDD 
Write your notes (in a readme file) regarding the BDD process, reflecting on the following questions.

Q: What was positive and good about using BDD?

A: I wrote my code with less errors then usual. Tests got auto-generated from features and scenarios.

Q: What was annoying or difficult?

A: The amount of writing gherkin (features and scenarios), was more then the actual code in the problem domain. Also you had to word the features and scenarios in a very specific way to get the auto-genereted unit test you wanted.  

Q: What surprised you?

A: That unit test got auto-generated. Also, the fact that I could test the converter API/Library/DLL without having to write a console app or a GUI.

Q: Did BDD help you understand the problem domain more?

A: Not really, the problem domain wasn't big enough. But I can see how it would do so, in a larger project. 

Q: Did BDD help you write some tests you wouldnâ€™t otherwise have thought of?

A: Yes, but it also added test that I didn't really need, because of my inexperience with writing good gherkin. Practice makes perfect, I guess :)
